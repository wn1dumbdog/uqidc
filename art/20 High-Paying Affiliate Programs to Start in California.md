## What Is Affiliate Marketing?

Affiliate marketing is a performance-based strategy where individuals, known as affiliates, earn commissions by promoting a company’s products or services. Affiliates receive unique referral links to track sales and conversions.

### Key Features of Affiliate Marketing:
- **Flexible Income Streams**: Choose programs with fixed or recurring commissions.
- **Targeted Niches**: Promote products that align with your audience’s interests.
- **Multiple Channels**: Use blogs, social media, YouTube, or email campaigns to drive traffic.

Recurring commissions are especially lucrative because they provide ongoing income as long as referred customers remain subscribed. This makes affiliate marketing an ideal method to build a stable passive income.

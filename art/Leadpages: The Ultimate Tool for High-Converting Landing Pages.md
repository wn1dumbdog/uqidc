### 2. LeadBoxes: Advanced Popup Lead Generation
LeadBoxes is one of Leadpages' most powerful features. These popups can be triggered by user interactions such as clicks on buttons, text, or images. For even more targeted engagement, LeadBoxes can be set to appear after a visitor spends a specific amount of time on your page or just as they are about to leave. The Exit LeadBox, for example, helps you retain potential leads by offering them valuable content before they navigate away.

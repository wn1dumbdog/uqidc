## Key Differences: HubSpot vs. Leadpages

### Email Tracking and Notifications
**HubSpot**: Comes with built-in email tracking software. You'll receive real-time notifications when a prospect opens your email or clicks a link, enabling you to follow up strategically.  
**Leadpages**: Lacks email tracking capabilities, leaving you in the dark about whether your emails were opened.

### Meeting Scheduler
**HubSpot**: Includes a meeting scheduler that syncs with your calendar. Prospects can book meetings directly, and all bookings are automatically added to your database.  
**Leadpages**: Does not offer a scheduling tool, requiring freelancers to manage meetings separately.

### Lead Management and CRM
**HubSpot**: Features a comprehensive CRM, allowing you to manage leads, track interactions, and run automated campaigns from a single platform.  
**Leadpages**: Focuses primarily on landing pages and does not include CRM features, making it less suitable for tracking and nurturing leads.

### Customization for Freelancers
